                is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.
                Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of
                football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include
                association
                football (known as soccer in some countries);
                gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football;
                rugby
                football (either rugby union or rugby league);
                and Gaelic football. These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are
                known as
                <b>football codes</b>.

        <p>There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different
            parts of the world.
            Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public
            schools
            during the 19th century.
            The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to
            areas of
            British influence outside the directly
            controlled Empire.By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic
            football, for example, deliberately incorporated the
            rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.[9] In 1888, The Football
            League
            was founded in England, becoming the first of
            many professional football competitions. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football
            grew
            to become some of the most popular team sports in
            the world.</p>

            <h2>Common elements</h2>
            <p>The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into two main classes of
                football:
                carrying codes like American football,
                Canadian football, Australian football, rugby union and rugby league, where the ball is moved about the
                field
                while being held in the hands or thrown,
                and kicking codes such as Association football and Gaelic football, where the ball is moved primarily
                with
                the
                feet, and where handling is strictly limited.</p>

            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <p>There are conflicting explanations of the origin of the word "football". It is widely assumed that the
                word
                "football" (or the phrase "foot ball")
                refers to the action of the foot kicking a ball.[13] There is an alternative explanation, which is that
                football
                originally referred to a variety of games
                in medieval Europe, which were played on foot. There is no conclusive evidence for either explanation.

            <h3>Ancient games</h3>
            <p>See also: Episkyros and Cuju</p>
            <h4>Ancient China</h4>
            <p>The Chinese competitive game cuju (蹴鞠), as stated by FIFA, is the earliest form of football for which
                there
                is
                scientific evidence and appears in a military
                manual dated to the second and third centuries BC.[14] It existed during the Han dynasty and possibly
                the
                Qin
                dynasty, in the second and third centuries BC.[15]
                The Japanese version of cuju is kemari (蹴鞠), and was developed during the Asuka period.[16] This is
                known to
                have been played within the Japanese imperial court
                in Kyoto from about 600 AD. In kemari several people stand in a circle and kick a ball to each other,
                trying
                not
                to let the ball drop to the ground (much like
                keepie uppie).</p>
